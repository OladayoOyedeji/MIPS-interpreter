{\bf Objectives}
\\
The purpose of this assignment is to show you that some C/C++ language 
features can be implemented in terms of simpler ones.

Specifically, we are going to look at a \lq\lq simplified'' C/C++.
Let's call it Very Simple C/C++.
In this Very Simple C/C++:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Each statement contains at most one arithmetic operator.
\item There is only one block, the \verb!main()! block. In other words 
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
int main()
{
    ...
}
\end{Verbatim}
is the only block and within this block, you are not 
allowed to have \verb!{! or \verb!}!.
\item The only if statement you see is of the form
\begin{Verbatim}
    if ([boolean expression]) goto [label];
\end{Verbatim} 
Therefore you also cannot use \verb!else!.
(Details on the goto statement are given below.)
\item There are no loop statements such as for-, while-, or do-while loops.
\end{enumerate}

You will see that although Very Simple C/C++ looks simpler and
restrictive, in fact it is really as powerful as our usual C/C++.
In particular, 
Q1 shows you that complex expressions can be replaced by simpler ones while 
Q2 and Q3 shows you that structures such as 
\begin{enumerate}
\li if statements/blocks,
\li if-else statements/blocks, and 
\li for-loop statements/blocks
\end{enumerate}
can be implemented in terms of 
\begin{enumerate}
\li goto statements and labels and
\li if statements of the form
\begin{Verbatim}
    if ([boolean expression]) goto [label];
\end{Verbatim}
\end{enumerate}
(Check wikipedia for \lq\lq structured programming''.)

The importance of questions Q1--Q3 lies in the fact that
the language syntax of assembly language in fact allows only 
\begin{enumerate}
\item simple arithmetic expressions
\item branching instructions (more or less if-goto statements)
\end{enumerate}
Therefore Q1-Q3 will conceptually prepare you for assembly language.

Another very important thing 
to realize is that although C/C++ {\it seems} to be
more powerful than Very Simple C/C++, they are actually equally powerful
in the sense that any problem solved by C/C++ can also be solved by 
Very Simple C/C++.
The only difference is the C/C++ has more structure (blocks, if, if-else,
loops, etc.) making it easier for the software engineer/developer to 
develop software systems.
Therefore if you have a machine that can run Very Simple C/C++ programs,
then you can run C/C++ programs if you have a way to translate
C/C++ syntax into Very Simple C/C++ syntax.
Back in the real world, this is exactly what happens:
A compiler translates C/C++ programs to assembly language programs.
This paradigm in Science and Engineering is common:
One builds systems in {\it layers}.

{\bf Submission instruction:} 
You must include a completed honor statement.
