the answer is $a = 0, b = 0$, because whenever we expand both we get
$10a + b = 8b + a$ and then we get the relationship between $a$ and $b$
we get $9a = 7b$ so $b = \frac{9}{7}a$ the only value of $a$ that can give an integer value is
$a = 7$ and that would make $b = 9$ and $b$ cant be $9$ because our constraint
is between $0 - 7$ so $a = b = 0$
